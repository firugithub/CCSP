** Terms 

1. Cloud 
2. Services - CLoud offers everything in the form of services. 
3. compute (CPU + Memory)
4. Network
5. Storage 
6. Pool 
7. Scalability 
8. Automation 
9. orchestration 
10. Abstraction - all the layer managed by AWS is hidden to the end user. 
11. CapEx - capital Expenditure 
12. OpEx - Operational Expenditure. 
13. Agility - Ability to support with the change in busienss requirements. 
              things can be done instantly with new reqs. 
              In onprem, it will take ages to get the server after lot of approvals.              
14. TCO - Total cost of ownership. 

TCO - Total cost of ownership. 
TCO Cost calculator of Azure Example. 

15. IMporved resource utilization - in onprem, 99% of time 30% resources are used and rest not. 
                                  - in cloud you will have improved. 
16. Customer - Controlled Migration - CLoud gives lot of options to migrate. 
17. Resilience - what matters to me is the quality service. 
    BC - Business Continuity - ability to continue business even in diaster is BC
    DR - Disaster Recovery - Complete process to bringing to Operation is DR. 
18. Pay for use - Pay for what you use. 

**drawbacks/risk
19. multi tenancy 
   eg:- to mitigate multi tenancy   
       a. access control 
       b. ecryption 
      Note:- even if you have dedicated derver in cloud, network, storage , administrator are same. 
20. third party admnistration - csp is administering. 

**NIST (if you want to say something as cloud, below features should be there)
21. Ondemand self service - no need of approvals from cloud provider to create the server in cloud. 
                            you have a self service portal 
22. Broader Network access - access anywhere from any device. 
23. Resource pooling - grouping all resource into 1 , these pools are scalable. 
24. rapid elasticity - flexibilty in creating and removing things 
                feature of elasticity is scalability 
                     - when requirement increases, we can increase or decrease the size 
            Note:- scalability is there because we have elasticity and
                   elasticity is there because we have virtualization                             
25. measured service - metered service , without this cloud computing is not economical. 


**disadvatange with above.

21. Ondemand Self Service disadvantage 
       - it can be disadvantage or least important 
       - Each and every person can create from anywhere and it may miss Approval Process. 
       - might lead to compliance issues. People can implement anything without proper approval. 

       to mitigate this is you need to enforce policies, access control, iam and need to be done from authorized devices and authorized controls. 

22. Broader Network access 
        - Can Access anywhere any corner of globe. if you allow customer data to be accessable anywhere it can lead in trouble and compliance issues not all devices have same security. 
        - data locations can complicate things. 
        - access from non standard devices can lead to issues. 

23. Resource pooling 
        - while pooling is cost effective but its multi-tenancy. 

24. Rapid elasticity 
        - while increase and decrease is possible , it will makes things during audit & assessment 
25. Multi tenancy risks 
        - shared resource, cross connections are possible. 
        - attacker may damage common compute performance. 

------------ 

22. Risk 
     - Positive - you are risking though benifits more. 
     - Negative - more risk less benifits 

------------ 

23. Risk cannot be shared to cloud 
   a. Data Security 
   b. GRC - governancne, Risk & COmpliance. 
   c. Reputation 

---------- 

27. Before going to CLoud 
  a. Shared Reponisbilty Model - Understand Demarcation b.w the CSP and customer. 
  b. Ensure that CSP has Proper Operational VIsibilty and COntrol, 
  c. ENsure that the CSP is compliant with any legal and regulatory requiremetns. 
  d. ENsure CSP has proper governance process and procedure with hose of the enterprise 
  e. see the availablity check from CSP the differene b.w 99.9% and 99.99% 
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#:~:text=High%20availability%20(HA)%20is%20a,increased%20reliance%20on%20these%20systems 

28. Ephemeral - temporary 
     AWS = instance store 
     Azure = temporary disk. 



-------- 

ELASTICITY - ON DEMAND 
 - scalable and Cost effective 

------- 

With Migration to CLoud you can only minimize risks but not eliminate risks. 

-------


29. Cryptographic shredding or cryptographic erasure - this is to ensure that data is deleted on the CSP Permanently. 

30. Global infrastructure 
    
    - Regions - Geographic region from where cloud operates  
    - AZ - inside regions , csp has more zones 
         - zone is something where they service customer 
         - each AZ - 1 or more DC 
    - DC - individually DC that has physical vm's 


    Azure 
      - LRS (when the data is copied the data is copied to same zone in multiple places) 
      - GRS - replicate the data to different zone. 

31. Contract & SLA - Minimum Gaurenteed Resources , 
the only way to ensure that things are guarenteed, then it is as per Contract & SLA 

32. CAIQ - Cloud Assessment initiative Questionaire 
https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/consensus-assessments-initiative-questionnaire-v3-1/

https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/CSA_Consensus_Assessments_Initiative_Questionnaire.pdf

AWS Artifacts - compliance and audit reports and agreements. some reports, you need to get NDA. 
Azure - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/microsoft-azure-responses-to-cloud-security-alliance-consensus-assessments-initiative-questionnaire-v301/

ISO 17789 - CLoud Standards and roles 

   4 layers for the cloud computing 
     Resource Layer (Provider or Datacenter layer)
        - Resource Abstraction & Control
        - Physical Resources 
     Service Layer (services offered by cloud)
        - Service Capabilities 
        - Business capabilities 
        - Administration Capabilities 
        - Service Orchestration. 
     Access layer (CLI,SDK,Portal)
        - Access Control 
        - Connection Management. 
     User Layer (User activity etc)
        - User Function 
        - Business Function 
        - Administrator Function. 

Job role 
    a. CSP (CLoud Service Provider) - they have technology they Provide Services (Data Custodian)
    b. CSC (CLoud Service Consumer/Customer) - Principal stakeholder that use computing services. 
    c. CS Partner (Cloud Service Partner) - they help in support of serices of cloud. 
     - CA (Cloud Auditor) - Party which performs indepent examination based on certain Standards. 
     - CB (CLoud Broker) - doesnt provide cloud service, cloud broker solutuions offer centralized inerface for 
                         multi clud acounts and manage to make this more effective. 
       Eg:- Dell Bhoomi 
       eg:- appirio 
       eg:- amazon.com.bluewolf  
    d. MSP - Managed services offer proffessional services.
    e. Cloud Resller -  i am taking service from somone wholesale and giving it to someone for the service. 
    In this case the ownership lies with the reseller. 
      eg:- Drop box 
            AWS --> Dropbox --> Customer 
    f. cloud backup service provider - you want to have a provider to store the backups. 
      eg:- VMWare , example you have cloud and vmware can help you copy of your data in a backup site. 
    g. Cloud carrier -> internet ISP is  cloud carier, deliver the cloud service to you. 
            which carries things. 


Offerings 
  a. IAAS - Infrastructure as a service 
  b. PAAS - Platform as a service 
  c. SAAS - Software as a service. 

Securing IAAS 
   - Data Protection 
   - Secure Data Deletion 
   - VM Migration 
   - Virtualization Best Practices 

-------
Crypto Shredding or cryptographic erasure. 

Encryption 
  - Dta 
  - Encrytpion engine 
  - Encryption key file which is important 

Encryption of Storage S3 --> encrypt using your key file and --> encrypt key file with anathor key 
in cryptoshredding , th encryption key files are deleted.
